Assignment 1: Logistic Regression
Welcome to week one of this specialization. You will learn about logistic regression. Concretely, you will be implementing logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will:

Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text
Implement logistic regression from scratch
Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
Test using your logistic regression
Perform error analysis
We will be using a data set of tweets. Hopefully you will get more than 99% accuracy.
Run the cell below to load in the packages.

Import functions and data
# run this cell to import nltk

from os import getcwd
Imported functions
Download the data needed for this assignment. Check out the documentation for the twitter_samples dataset.

twitter_samples: if you're running this notebook on your local computer, you will need to download it using:

nltk.download('twitter_samples')
stopwords: if you're running this notebook on your local computer, you will need to download it using:

nltk.download('stopwords')
Import some helper functions that we provided in the utils.py file:
process_tweet(): cleans the text, tokenizes it into separate words, removes stopwords, and converts words to stems.
build_freqs(): this counts how often a word in the 'corpus' (the entire set of tweets) was associated with a positive label '1' or a negative label '0', then builds the freqs dictionary, where each key is a (word,label) tuple, and the value is the count of its frequency within the corpus of tweets.
# add folder, tmp2, from our local workspace containing pre-downloaded corpora files to nltk's data path
# this enables importing of these files without downloading it again when we refresh our workspace
​
filePath = f"{getcwd()}/../tmp2/"
nltk.data.path.append(filePath)
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from nltk.corpus import twitter_samples 
​
from utils import process_tweet, build_freqs
Prepare the data
The twitter_samples contains subsets of 5,000 positive tweets, 5,000 negative tweets, and the full set of 10,000 tweets.
If you used all three datasets, we would introduce duplicates of the positive tweets and negative tweets.
You will select just the five thousand positive tweets and five thousand negative tweets.
# select the set of positive and negative tweets
all_positive_tweets = twitter_samples.strings('positive_tweets.json')
all_negative_tweets = twitter_samples.strings('negative_tweets.json')
Train test split: 20% will be in the test set, and 80% in the training set.
# split the data into two pieces, one for training and one for testing (validation set) 
test_pos = all_positive_tweets[4000:]
train_pos = all_positive_tweets[:4000]
test_neg = all_negative_tweets[4000:]
train_neg = all_negative_tweets[:4000]
​
train_x = train_pos + train_neg 
test_x = test_pos + test_neg
Create the numpy array of positive labels and negative labels.
# combine positive and negative labels
train_y = np.append(np.ones((len(train_pos), 1)), np.zeros((len(train_neg), 1)), axis=0)
test_y = np.append(np.ones((len(test_pos), 1)), np.zeros((len(test_neg), 1)), axis=0)
# Print the shape train and test sets
print("train_y.shape = " + str(train_y.shape))
print("test_y.shape = " + str(test_y.shape))
train_y.shape = (8000, 1)
test_y.shape = (2000, 1)
Create the frequency dictionary using the imported build_freqs() function.
We highly recommend that you open utils.py and read the build_freqs() function to understand what it is doing.
To view the file directory, go to the menu and click File->Open.
    for y,tweet in zip(ys, tweets):
        for word in process_tweet(tweet):
            pair = (word, y)
            if pair in freqs:
                freqs[pair] += 1
            else:
                freqs[pair] = 1
Notice how the outer for loop goes through each tweet, and the inner for loop steps through each word in a tweet.
The freqs dictionary is the frequency dictionary that's being built.
The key is the tuple (word, label), such as ("happy",1) or ("happy",0). The value stored for each key is the count of how many times the word "happy" was associated with a positive label, or how many times "happy" was associated with a negative label.
# create frequency dictionary
freqs = build_freqs(train_x, train_y)
​
# check the output
print("type(freqs) = " + str(type(freqs)))
print("len(freqs) = " + str(len(freqs.keys())))
type(freqs) = <class 'dict'>
len(freqs) = 11346
Expected output
type(freqs) = <class 'dict'>
len(freqs) = 11346
Process tweet
The given function process_tweet() tokenizes the tweet into individual words, removes stop words and applies stemming.

# test the function below
print('This is an example of a positive tweet: \n', train_x[0])
print('\nThis is an example of the processed version of the tweet: \n', process_tweet(train_x[0]))
This is an example of a positive tweet: 
 #FollowFriday @France_Inte @PKuchly57 @Milipol_Paris for being top engaged members in my community this week :)

This is an example of the processed version of the tweet: 
 ['followfriday', 'top', 'engag', 'member', 'commun', 'week', ':)']
Expected output
This is an example of a positive tweet: 
 #FollowFriday @France_Inte @PKuchly57 @Milipol_Paris for being top engaged members in my community this week :)

This is an example of the processes version: 
 ['followfriday', 'top', 'engag', 'member', 'commun', 'week', ':)']
Part 1: Logistic regression
Part 1.1: Sigmoid
You will learn to use logistic regression for text classification.

The sigmoid function is defined as:
ℎ(𝑧)=11+exp−𝑧(1)
It maps the input 'z' to a value that ranges between 0 and 1, and so it can be treated as a probability.

Instructions: Implement the sigmoid function
You will want this function to work if z is a scalar as well as if it is an array.

Logistic regression: regression and a sigmoid
Logistic regression takes a regular linear regression, and applies a sigmoid to the output of the linear regression.

Regression:
𝑧=𝜃0𝑥0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+...𝜃𝑁𝑥𝑁
Note that the 𝜃 values are "weights". If you took the Deep Learning Specialization, we referred to the weights with the w vector. In this course, we're using a different variable 𝜃 to refer to the weights.

Logistic regression
ℎ(𝑧)=11+exp−𝑧
𝑧=𝜃0𝑥0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+...𝜃𝑁𝑥𝑁
We will refer to 'z' as the 'logits'.

Part 1.2 Cost function and Gradient
The cost function used for logistic regression is the average of the log loss across all training examples:

𝐽(𝜃)=−1𝑚∑𝑖=1𝑚𝑦(𝑖)log(ℎ(𝑧(𝜃)(𝑖)))+(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−ℎ(𝑧(𝜃)(𝑖)))(5)
𝑚 is the number of training examples
𝑦(𝑖) is the actual label of the i-th training example.
ℎ(𝑧(𝜃)(𝑖)) is the model's prediction for the i-th training example.
The loss function for a single training example is
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=−1×(𝑦(𝑖)log(ℎ(𝑧(𝜃)(𝑖)))+(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−ℎ(𝑧(𝜃)(𝑖))))
All the ℎ values are between 0 and 1, so the logs will be negative. That is the reason for the factor of -1 applied to the sum of the two loss terms.
Note that when the model predicts 1 (ℎ(𝑧(𝜃))=1) and the label 𝑦 is also 1, the loss for that training example is 0.
Similarly, when the model predicts 0 (ℎ(𝑧(𝜃))=0) and the actual label is also 0, the loss for that training example is 0.
However, when the model prediction is close to 1 (ℎ(𝑧(𝜃))=0.9999) and the label is 0, the second term of the log loss becomes a large negative number, which is then multiplied by the overall factor of -1 to convert it to a positive loss value. −1×(1−0)×𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−0.9999)≈9.2 The closer the model prediction gets to 1, the larger the loss.
# verify that when the model predicts close to 1, but the actual label is 0, the loss is a large positive value
-1 * (1 - 0) * np.log(1 - 0.9999) # loss is about 9.2
9.210340371976294
Likewise, if the model predicts close to 0 (ℎ(𝑧)=0.0001) but the actual label is 1, the first term in the loss function becomes a large number: −1×𝑙𝑜𝑔(0.0001)≈9.2. The closer the prediction is to zero, the larger the loss.
# verify that when the model predicts close to 0 but the actual label is 1, the loss is a large positive value
-1 * np.log(0.0001) # loss is about 9.2
9.210340371976182
Update the weights
To update your weight vector 𝜃, you will apply gradient descent to iteratively improve your model's predictions.
The gradient of the cost function 𝐽 with respect to one of the weights 𝜃𝑗 is:

∇𝜃𝑗𝐽(𝜃)=1𝑚∑𝑖=1𝑚(ℎ(𝑖)−𝑦(𝑖))𝑥𝑗(5)
'i' is the index across all 'm' training examples.
'j' is the index of the weight 𝜃𝑗, so 𝑥𝑗 is the feature associated with weight 𝜃𝑗
To update the weight 𝜃𝑗, we adjust it by subtracting a fraction of the gradient determined by 𝛼:
𝜃𝑗=𝜃𝑗−𝛼×∇𝜃𝑗𝐽(𝜃)
The learning rate 𝛼 is a value that we choose to control how big a single update will be.
Instructions: Implement gradient descent function
The number of iterations num_iters is the number of times that you'll use the entire training set.
For each iteration, you'll calculate the cost function using all training examples (there are m training examples), and for all features.
Instead of updating a single weight 𝜃𝑖 at a time, we can update all the weights in the column vector:
𝜃=𝜃0𝜃1𝜃2⋮𝜃𝑛
𝜃 has dimensions (n+1, 1), where 'n' is the number of features, and there is one more element for the bias term 𝜃0 (note that the corresponding feature value 𝐱0 is 1).
The 'logits', 'z', are calculated by multiplying the feature matrix 'x' with the weight vector 'theta'. 𝑧=𝐱𝜃
𝐱 has dimensions (m, n+1)
𝜃: has dimensions (n+1, 1)
𝐳: has dimensions (m, 1)
The prediction 'h', is calculated by applying the sigmoid to each element in 'z': ℎ(𝑧)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑(𝑧), and has dimensions (m,1).
The cost function 𝐽 is calculated by taking the dot product of the vectors 'y' and 'log(h)'. Since both 'y' and 'h' are column vectors (m,1), transpose the vector to the left, so that matrix multiplication of a row vector with column vector performs the dot product.
𝐽=−1𝑚×(𝐲𝑇⋅𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐡)+(1−𝐲)𝑇⋅𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−𝐡))
The update of theta is also vectorized. Because the dimensions of 𝐱 are (m, n+1), and both 𝐡 and 𝐲 are (m, 1), we need to transpose the 𝐱 and place it on the left in order to perform matrix multiplication, which then yields the (n+1, 1) answer we need:
𝜃=𝜃−𝛼𝑚×(𝐱𝑇⋅(𝐡−𝐲))

Part 2: Extracting the features
Given a list of tweets, extract the features and store them in a matrix. You will extract two features.
The first feature is the number of positive words in a tweet.
The second feature is the number of negative words in a tweet.
Then train your logistic regression classifier on these features.
Test the classifier on a validation set.
Instructions: Implement the extract_features function.
This function takes in a single tweet.
Process the tweet using the imported process_tweet() function and save the list of tweet words.
Loop through each word in the list of processed words
For each word, check the freqs dictionary for the count when that word has a positive '1' label. (Check for the key (word, 1.0)
Do the same for the count for when the word is associated with the negative label '0'. (Check for the key (word, 0.0).)

Part 3: Training Your Model
To train the model:

Stack the features for all training examples into a matrix X.
Call gradientDescent, which you've implemented above.
This section is given to you. Please read it for understanding and run the cell.

# collect the features 'x' and stack them into a matrix 'X'
X = np.zeros((len(train_x), 3))
for i in range(len(train_x)):
    X[i, :]= extract_features(train_x[i], freqs)

# training labels corresponding to X
Y = train_y

Part 4: Test your logistic regression
It is time for you to test your logistic regression function on some new input that your model has not seen before.

Instructions: Write predict_tweet
Predict whether a tweet is positive or negative.

Given a tweet, process it, then extract the features.
Apply the model's learned weights on the features to get the logits.
Apply the sigmoid to the logits to get the prediction (a value between 0 and 1).

Check performance using the test set
After training your model using the training set above, check how your model might perform on real, unseen data, by testing it against the test set.

Instructions: Implement test_logistic_regression
Given the test data and the weights of your trained model, calculate the accuracy of your logistic regression model.
Use your predict_tweet() function to make predictions on each tweet in the test set.
If the prediction is > 0.5, set the model's classification y_hat to 1, otherwise set the model's classification y_hat to 0.
A prediction is accurate when y_hat equals test_y. Sum up all the instances when they are equal and divide by m.
